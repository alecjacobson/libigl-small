# libigl - A simple C++ geometry processing library

![](tutorial/images/libigl-logo.jpg)

<https://github.com/libigl/libigl/>

libigl is a simple C++ geometry processing library. We have a wide
functionality including construction of sparse discrete differential geometry
operators and finite-elements matrices such as the contangent Laplacian and
diagonalized mass matrix, simple facet and edge-based topology data structures,
mesh-viewing utilities for OpenGL and GLSL, and many core functions for matrix
manipulation which make [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) feel a lot more
like MATLAB.

It is first and foremost a header library. Each header file contains a single
function. Most are tailored to operate on a generic triangle mesh stored in an
n-by-3 matrix of vertex positions V and an m-by-3 matrix of triangle indices F.
The library may also be [compiled](build/README.md) into a statically linked
library, for faster compile times with your projects.

We use the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library heavily in our code. Our
group prototypes a lot in MATLAB, and we have a useful [conversion
table](matlab-to-eigen.html) from
MATLAB to libigl/Eigen.

# Tutorial

As of version 1.0, libigl includes an introductory
[tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.html) that covers
its basic functionalities.

## Installation
Libigl is a *header* library. You do **not** need to build anything to install.
Simply add `igl/` to your include path and include relevant headers. Here is a
small "Hello, World" program:

```cpp
#include <igl/cotmatrix.h>
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <Eigen/Sparse>
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  Eigen::MatrixXd V(4,2);
  V<<0,0,
     1,0,
     1,1,
     0,1;
  Eigen::MatrixXi F(2,3);
  F<<0,1,2,
     0,2,3;
  Eigen::SparseMatrix<double> L;
  igl::cotmatrix(V,F,L);
  std::cout<<"Hello, mesh: "<<std::endl<<L*V<<std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

If you save this in `hello.cpp`, then you could compile this with (assuming
Eigen is installed in /opt/local/include/eigen3):

```bash
gcc -I/opt/local/include/eigen3 -I./igl/ hello.cpp -o hello
```

Running `./hello` would then produce

```
Hello, mesh:
 0.5  0.5
-0.5  0.5
-0.5 -0.5
 0.5 -0.5
```

## Dependencies
Dependencies are on a per-include basis and the majority of the functions in
libigl depends only on the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library.

For more information see our [tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.html).
