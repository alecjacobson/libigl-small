  \section path_tracer_intro Photo-Realistic Example Renderer

  The Embree Example Renderer is a photo-realistic renderer that
  builds on the Embree high performance ray tracing kernels. The
  renderer is used to demonstrate how Embree is used in practice and
  to measure Embree's performance in a realistic application
  scenario. The Embree Example Renderer is not a full featured
  renderer and not designed to be used for production renderering. The
  Embree Example Renderer is released as Open Source under the Apache
  2.0 license.

  In ealier versions of Embree this photo-realistic renderer was part
  of the Embree kernel repository. In fact, this path tracer was
  initially rather tightly coupled to the Embree kernels, and has over
  time evolved into something that eventually became bigger than the
  kernels themselves.

  In the process of re-focusing Embree on the actual kernels (that
  most users' interest is in) and to make it easier to use the
  kernels without having to understand the whole project, starting in
  version 2.1 we have created a stricter separation between the actual
  kernels and the sample codes that use those kernels.

  Consequently, we have moved the Embree Example Renderer
  into a separate repository dedicated to this renderer. This path
  tracer is still being maintained, and is still kept in sync with the
  Embree kernels; but it has to be checked out and built separately
  from the kernels.

  \section path_tracer_getting Checking out the Sample Path Tracer 

  The example renderer is only available in source form and can be
  downloaded using the following ZIP file:

     http://github.com/embree/embree-renderer/archive/v2.1_alpha.zip

  Alternatively you can also use git to get the latest Embree Example
  Renderer 2.1:
      
     git clone https://github.com/embree/embree-renderer.git embree-renderer
     cd embree-renderer
     git checkout v2.1
